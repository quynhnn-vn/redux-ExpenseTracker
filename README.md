# React Redux Project: Expense Tracker

Build a budgeting and expense tracking app:
- Set budgets for various categories
- Add transactions in those categories
- Track transactions and calculate the remaining money to be spent in each category

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
